AI-Powered Refugee Document Retrieval and Verification System

Overview

The AI-Powered Refugee Document Retrieval and Verification System is a groundbreaking platform designed to help refugees securely retrieve and verify lost academic and professional documents. Utilizing advanced AI and blockchain technologies, this solution offers a safer, more efficient, and user-friendly process, eliminating the risks and costs that typically prevent displaced people from accessing critical opportunities in education and employment. Initially targeted toward refugees from DR Congo and South Sudan in Uganda's Nakivale Refugee Camp, the system’s long-term vision is to expand globally, benefiting anyone who has lost essential documents and becoming a leading digital solution in document verification.

Motivation

The motivation for creating this platform is deeply rooted in both professional research and personal experience. As a refugee, I faced significant barriers after fleeing Congo without the necessary documentation to continue my education or secure employment. I was fortunate to have the support of Laura, a compassionate individual with connections who was able to help me recover my lost documents. This support became a turning point in my life, allowing me to access opportunities that have shaped my future. My personal experience showed me the profound impact of document recovery and inspired me to make this process accessible to other refugees facing similar barriers.

In my research, I found that many refugees in Nakivale Refugee Camp faced almost insurmountable challenges in obtaining critical documents. Many were desperate to secure jobs that required documentation and were willing to pay up to $200 for intermediaries to travel back to conflict-ridden areas like DR Congo to retrieve these documents. Sadly, this process often failed. In some cases, intermediaries disappeared with the funds; in others, they encountered danger on the journey or returned only with photocopies that lacked certification, leaving them unusable. For those seeking jobs with starting salaries of $300, this cycle of lost funds and continued unemployment was devastating. Based on my findings, over 1,000 refugees in Nakivale alone were caught in this situation, highlighting an urgent need for a secure and reliable solution.

This motivation was further reinforced during my internship with CIYOTA, where I encountered countless refugee students facing similar challenges. Most were unable to afford the $100 translation fees for document validation in Uganda, let alone manage the costs and risks of retrieval. Working with CIYOTA, I helped students connect with educational institutions in Congo to retrieve documents, arranged translations, and achieved validation with the support of Ashesi University. These efforts enabled several students to apply and be accepted into educational programs, empowering them to rebuild their lives. Witnessing the transformative impact of verified documentation inspired me to develop a scalable solution that could have an even broader impact.

Research Insights and Market Potential

The findings from my research underscore the significant demand for a reliable and secure document retrieval system. Refugees frequently spend substantial amounts of money on intermediaries and are willing to take financial risks in the hope of retrieving essential documents. My data indicated that many refugees were prepared to pay $200 per retrieval attempt, despite knowing the risks. In Nakivale alone, over 1,000 refugees had been caught in cycles of lost funds, unverified documents, and job rejections due to non-credible records. The AI-powered solution we propose offers a streamlined alternative, utilizing secure, verifiable retrieval methods that reduce costs and risks for refugees.

Revenue and Social Impact Potential

This platform is designed to provide both meaningful social impact and financial sustainability. With an affordable and transparent fee structure, we estimate that if 1,000 refugees from Nakivale use the service annually, the platform could generate approximately $200,000 in revenue. Given the high demand across refugee camps worldwide, expanding the service to a broader market could significantly increase both impact and revenue.

Beyond Nakivale, the platform has the potential to serve millions globally, generating substantial revenue while empowering refugees to regain educational and employment opportunities. The vision is to extend this service beyond the refugee community, making it available to anyone who has lost important documents. Over time, we aim for the platform to become a global resource for document retrieval and verification, setting a new standard in security, accessibility, and affordability. This expanded mission could open up additional revenue streams, positioning the platform as a vital tool for anyone requiring authenticated documents.

Proposed Solution

The AI-Powered Document Retrieval and Verification System includes the following features:

Database of Schools and Organizations: A database of trusted schools and organizations, including sample document templates, will serve as references to verify documents from the country of origin.

Collaborator Database: A network of partner schools and organizations that will accept documents verified by the platform, making document verification smoother and increasing user confidence in its credibility.

NLP for Document Request Generation: A fine-tuned NLP model generates and translates formal requests for lost documents in multiple languages, ensuring effective communication with educational institutions.

Predictive Model for Document Tracking: This model tracks and predicts the retrieval status of document requests, providing users with real-time updates and estimated processing times.

AI-Based Validation (CNN with OCR): By combining CNN with OCR, the platform can authenticate documents and verify them against blockchain records, preventing fraud and ensuring document reliability.

Conversational AI Model: The platform’s chatbot, powered by conversational AI, offers real-time assistance, answering queries, guiding users through the document recovery process, and addressing common concerns.




App Functionality and features

Homepage: Introduces the platform, with quick access to “Request Document,” “Track Request,” “Verify Document,” and “Support” features.

Request Document Page: Users can submit document requests with personal and document details, generating an official request to the relevant institution.

Track Request Page: Real-time tracking updates keep users informed of their document’s retrieval status, offering transparency and peace of mind.

Verify Document Page: Users upload documents for verification, where AI and blockchain validate them against trusted templates.

Support Page: Equipped with an AI chatbot for user guidance and a contact form for additional support.





Next Steps

The initial focus will be on refugees from DR Congo and South Sudan in Nakivale, with plans to expand to additional regions and eve non refugees populations meaning everyone who has lost his document could get them through our platform. The project aims to effectively address the issue of lost documents and support refugees in accessing academic and professional opportunities despite their challenges.
